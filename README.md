Programming Fundamentals – Basic C Programs Introduction: This repository contains a collection of beginner-level C programming exercises designed to build fundamental skills in programming logic, variables, operators, input/output handling, and mathematical computations. All programs are written in C language, compiled using standard GCC compiler, and follow simple procedural logic. These exercises were completed as part of my Programming Fundamentals course. List of Programs:

Program Title: File Name
1 Assign values to three variables: Q1.c

2 Print message: “C language is a powerful programming language.”: Q2.c

3 Interchange values of two variables: Q3.c

4 Convert years into months: Q4.c

5 Input two numbers, calculate sum & product: Q5.c

6 Convert age in years to months: Q6.c

7 Student marks: total & average: Q7.c

8 Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion: Q8.c

9 Find maximum of four numbers: Q9.c

10 Convert miles to kilometers: Q10.c

12 Volume of cylinder (using const): Q12.c

13 Area of circle (using #define): Q13.c

14 Convert millimeters to inches: Q14.c

15 Interchange values of two variables (simple swap): Q15.c

16 Multiple assignment & product: Q16.c

17 Separate integral and fractional parts: Q17.c

18 Compute ‘s’ using formula S = vi·t + ½at²: Q18.c

How to Run These Programs
Using GCC (for C programs)

Compile:

gcc program01.c -o program01

Run

./program01

Repeat the same for any file by replacing the filename.
